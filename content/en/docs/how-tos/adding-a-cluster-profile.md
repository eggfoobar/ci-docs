This document lays out the process of getting a new cluster profile added to the test platform so that jobs can begin using it.

{{< alert title="Info" color="info" >}}

Adding a cluster profile is just one of the steps necessary to enable CI for new platforms. For the high-level information
about platform enablement process, please see the [OpenShift Infrastructure Provider Onboarding](http://docs.providers.openshift.org/continuous-integration-and-testing/) Guide.

## What Is a Cluster Profile?

The `cluster_profile` is a `ci-operator` concept that bundles together a couple of concepts to make it easier to configure jobs and steps that can operate on different cloud infrastructures.

When a `cluster_profile` is added to a job or workflow, the following actions occur:

- all steps in the workflow will have [`credentials`](/docs/architecture/step-registry/#injecting-custom-credentials) mounted at `$CLUSTER_PROFILE_DIR` for cloud accounts, image registries, etc.
- the test will implicitly ask for a [`lease`](/docs/architecture/step-registry/#implicit-lease-configuration-with-cluster_profile) and expose it with `$LEASED_RESOURCE`
- all steps in the test will implicitly declare [`dependencies`](/docs/architecture/ci-operator/#referring-to-images-in-tests) on imported OpenShift release images
- all steps will have a number of environment variables set, such as `$CLUSTER_TYPE`, `$IMAGE_FORMAT`, and `$KUBECONFIG`

Generally, the major difference between `cluster_profile`s is the content of the credentials.

## Adding a New Cluster Profile

When adding a new `cluster_profile`, three major steps must be taken: registering the profile inside of `ci-operator`, adding the new leases to `Boskos`, and providing the credentials.

### Registering a New Profile

As `cluster-profile`s are handled as first-class items in the `ci-operator`
configuration, a new pull request ([example](https://github.com/openshift/ci-tools/pull/2808))
must be sent to the `openshift/ci-tools` repository in order to register a new
profile.  The next sections detail the requirements for opening this pull
request.  All changes required in `openshift/ci-tools` are isolated to a single
file, [`pkg/api/types.go`](https://github.com/openshift/ci-tools/blob/master/pkg/api/types.go).
The process of creating a new cluster profile involves adding:

- `ClusterProfile`: a new constant for the name of the profile.
- `ClusterProfiles()`: a new item in the list of valid test profiles.
- `ClusterProfile::ClusterType()`: a mapping from the profile to its
  [cluster type]({{< relref "#cluster-type" >}}).
- `ClusterProfile::LeaseType()`: a mapping from the profile to its
  [lease type]({{< relref "#adding-new-leases" >}}).
- `LeaseTypeFromClusterType()`: a mapping from cluster type to lease type, if
  a new type is being added (this is only used for legacy template tests).
- `ClusterProfile::ConfigMap()`: a `switch` label if the profile requires its
  own `ConfigMap`.
- `ClusterProfile::Secret()`: a `switch` label if the profile shares
  [credentials]({{< relref "#providing-credentials" >}}) with another.

### Cluster type

This value is passed to tests via the `CLUSTER_TYPE` environment variable, as
mentioned in the introduction.  It is used for cloud-provider-specific behavior
by step registry components such as the OpenShift installer steps
([e.g.](https://steps.ci.openshift.org/reference/ipi-install-install)).

For profiles created for completely new platforms, this should be a unique value
and will probably require corresponding changes to the installation steps.
Profiles which are derivatives of existing ones should likely retain the cluster
type unless they require special treatment in the installation process.

### Adding New Leases

In the pull request to `openshift/ci-tools`, the mapping between a `cluster_profile` and the implicit `lease` that will be requested is determined. The standard is to use leases named `<name>-quota-slice`, so the `aws` profile uses `aws-quota-slice`. The resources for leasing must be [registered](/docs/architecture/quota-and-leases/#adding-a-new-type-of-resource) with our leasing server ([example](https://github.com/openshift/release/commit/1f775399dfd636a1feca304fb9b6944ca2dd8fb9#diff-5169f2a74d1497f38a44e9adc57f6993269a89c3ddf90ab01f5d1d114ef61e58)).

### Providing Credentials

The credentials provided to tests that declare a `cluster_profile` are a mix of content owned by the test platform and content owned by the users adding a new `cluster_profile`. The secret used to hold this content is `cluster-secrets-<name>`, so the `aws` profile uses `cluster-secrets-aws`. When adding a new profile, a pull request must change the `ci-secret-bootstrap` configuration to seed this credential with content owned by the platform, like central pull secrets for image registries ([example](https://github.com/openshift/release/commit/1f775399dfd636a1feca304fb9b6944ca2dd8fb9#diff-6f809450f5216bc90d0c08b723c9fe080da1358283bbf47c42f05bfc589c49fd)). In addition, any user-provided secrets must be added using the [self-service portal](/docs/how-tos/adding-a-new-secret-to-ci/#add-a-new-secret) to add it to the clusters, using the following keys in Vault (the destination namespace/name needs to match the item added to the `ci-secret-bootstrap` config):

{{< highlight yaml >}}
secretsync/target-namespace: "ci"
secretsync/target-name: "cluster-secrets-<name>"
{{< / highlight >}}

The `openshift/ci-tools` pull request should also include instructions on how
the data provided should be assembled into a volume mount for the test
containers.  The code is structured so that common cases require few or no
changes.  These are:

- Credentials are mounted using a simple `Secret` mount.
  - The convention is for the secret to be named `cluster-secrets-<name>`, in
    which case no change is required.
  - In some cases, derivative profiles may want to use the same credentials as
    the original.  All existing profiles follow the convention of being named
    after their `CLUSTER_TYPE`, so usually a single new `switch` label is
    required in this case.
- A `ConfigMap` is required for the profile.  The convention is for it to be
  named `cluster-profile-<name>`, in which case a single new `switch` label is
  required.

## VPN connection

For platforms that need access to restricted environments, `ci-operator`
supports adding a dedicated VPN connection to each test step.  Since this is a
requirement of specific platforms, it is triggered by special files in the
[cluster profile(s)]({{< ref "docs/how-tos/adding-a-cluster-profile#what-is-a-cluster-profile" >}})
associated with those platforms.  This process is transparent to the test
command: when a VPN connection is requested at the test level, it is set up
automatically by the test platform with no changes required to individual tests.

### Cluster profile

VPN connections are requested by the presence of a special file named `vpn.yaml`
in the cluster profile, detected when the test steps are about to be executed.
This file should have the following fields:

- `image`: _pull spec_ of the image to be used for the VPN client container.
  This image should contain the packages necessary to establish the connection,
  as well as the `bash` shell to execute the container's entry point script.
- `commands`: the name of another file in the cluster profile (e.g.
  `openvpn.sh`) which contains the VPN client's entry point script.  This script
  is effectively executed as `bash -c "$(<f")"`, where `f` is the value
  associated with the `commands` key.
- `wait_timeout`: the maximum amount of time the step script should wait before
  starting (detailed in the next section).  This ensures the steps are not
  blocked until the test timeout (several hours) expires if any problems occur
  with the VPN client.

### Client container

The container should execute the VPN client to establish the connection.  It
will reside in the same network namespace as the test container, so no special
provisions are necessary to make the networking changes usable by the test
program.  When executed, the entry point program will be located in the
directory where the cluster profile files are mounted, so all secrets will be
available and can be referenced with a relative path.

In addition to executing the client, the container has also two synchronization
points:

- When the connection has been established and the test script should start, a
  file named `/tmp/vpn/up` should be created.  For OpenVPN, for example, the
  following options can be used:

{{< highlight bash >}}
openvpn --script-security 2 --route-up '/bin/bash -c "touch /tmp/vpn/up"' â€¦
{{< / highlight >}}

- The script should watch for the creation of a file indicating that the main
  test has finished and then exit so that the test can terminate properly.  This
  marker file is created automatically by the CI infrastructure at
  `/logs/marker-file.txt`.  The client can perform these actions with a script
  such as:

{{< highlight bash >}}
function exit_with_test() {
    until [[ -f /logs/marker-file.txt ]]; do sleep 1; done
    while :; do kill 1; sleep 1; done
}

exit_with_test &
# run the VPN client
{{< / highlight >}}

{{< alert title="Note" color="info" >}}
N.b. both containers start simultaneously, so the test may exit before the VPN
client starts.
